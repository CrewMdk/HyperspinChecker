TODO:
- RL fade preview and editor
- move mode when in another directory, in subfoldered mode is missing (code is missing)
- copy (duplicate) mode in the same folder, just rename file in filelist instead of duplicating
- sort systems
- save renaming history to file
- drag & drop in system manager
- while in edit mode in the cell, click or right click on another cell - error - can't reproduce
- todo - create db from files/folders - disable fill crc if folder is selected
- todo - create db from files/folders - automatically suggest output name, based on output folder and output filename
- when renaming in another folder (copy or move), and only show unmatched files, files not disappear when renaming
- better renaming log
- Copy rom from another folder - ask to rename files in every archive
- Subfoldered mode - matched/unmatched should have option (enabled by default) to match a FILE inside a FOLDER, not only folder name
- move copy/move/rename/duplicate controls from options menu to main matcher window
- Hide CHECK button (and other controls) when checking
- deplayment

DONE:
+ save last check result and show it in system manager table
+ fix changeSeleted in listbox in renaming
+ show any defaultly hided column, save table config, restart checker. Column is shown, but menu item does not checked
+ Ajust font in listboxes
+ hotkey (ctrl+enter?) to enter in cell edit mode
+ copy just a cell, not entire line in the table, when in edit mode
+ MSU renaming
+ add in 'handle theese extension togeether' list does not clear textbox
+ find-as-you-type in matcher listboxes
+ filter in db entry listbox is not working
+ If a disk does not exist (network drive) should ask to continue in another path, not abort

ANY EMULATOR SHOULD HAVE - borderless fullscreen, cheat support, save-state support (available from gamepad), filters, turbo mode (available from gamepad),
			   floppy and hdd activity hud

Fixed:
------

Acorn BBC		+ Explorer - bad command - an additional cartridge (rom) was needed;
			+ Gnome Ranger - freeze on intro text; (it's actually working. Just need to wait, and type commands after prompt)
			+ Pop Quiz -  'disk read only' error - fixed by adding 'readeble' flag to this game in RL module settings;
			+ Sporting triangles - incorrect disk complains on background. Need alt-enter to see a dialog box - works with "BBC Master 128" model;
			+ Through the dragon eye - can't press escape - works with "BBC Master 128" model
			+ change disk - Working
Alf			+ universal emulator common problemes - change resolution, fullscreen cropped - set to borderless window mode
Amstrad CPC		+ can't change disk.
			+ Alien Storm freeze - actually, just need to change disk when it begins to load.

Entex Adventurevision	+ Find more roms - There is only 4
Mattel Aquarius		+ tapes boots to OS
			? Use dxWnd for fullscreen mode. Switching back to window mode (F12) is quite glitchy
