HowTo: Cut a video directly with ffmpeg, without re-encoding
You only need the -ss and -t options. -ss is the starttime and -t the duration, so if you want 10 seconds from a video starting from minute one, you would use this.
 
ffmpeg -i INFILE.mp4 -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 00:01:00.000 -t 00:00:10.000 OUTFILE.mp4

You can use seconds or hh:mm:ss[.xxx] as arguments for the start time and duration, i prefer the second option.
 The options -vcodec copy and -acodec copy are used to only cut the video and disable the re-encoding, this really speed things up. ;) 


Checking all renaming branches:
- All dir modes (copy, move, src_dir, dst_dir)
- Folder mode
- If destination file exist
- Archive with and without renaming inside, with and without multiple files inside
- mdf/mds or other pairs
- cue/bin (special pair case)
-
