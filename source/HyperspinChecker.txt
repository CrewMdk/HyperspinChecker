Yet another Hyperspin rom & media manager

I don't really know if I'm allowed to post it here, if not, i will remove it.

First of all - Forgive me my poor English, some of notes in the program could be understandable, i'm very sorry for this.

Proof of concept.
Some futures doesn't work.
Expect bugs (no destructive, i hope).

- check for roms / videos / themes / wheels / artworks
- move unneeded roms/media to subfolder
- collect missing media from another folders
- crop hyperspin database to contain only roms you have
- match you media names with db entry
- check cd images for variuos problems
- open source
- ...

If you want to request a feature, report a bug, or just request to rename a label, please post here, i will fill all the requests as soon as possible.
